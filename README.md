# Sprint & Sip - Accessibility Testing Example

This repository contains a simple demonstration website for "Sprint & Sip," a fictional coffee shop and running store. This website is **intentionally designed with accessibility issues** for educational purposes.

## Purpose

This website serves as a practical example for:

- Testing accessibility evaluation tools such as WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
- Demonstrating common accessibility errors and issues
- Providing a teaching resource for web accessibility concepts

**IMPORTANT:** This is NOT an example of best practices or proper web design. Many elements have been deliberately implemented with accessibility issues for testing purposes.

## Website Structure

The simplified website includes the following pages:

- **Home (index.html)**: A landing page with basic information
- **Coffee (coffee.html)**: Page showcasing coffee products
- **Run Club (run-club.html)**: Information about a fictional running club
- **Brunch Menu**: Links to a PDF file

## How to Use This Example

1. Open the website in your browser
2. Use accessibility evaluation tools like WAVE (https://wave.webaim.org/) to identify issues
3. Compare the findings with accessibility guidelines (WCAG)
4. Consider how each issue could be remediated

## Educational Notes
